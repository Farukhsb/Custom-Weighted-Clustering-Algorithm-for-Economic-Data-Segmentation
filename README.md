# Custom Weighted Clustering Algorithm for Economic Data Segmentation

A sophisticated Python implementation of an adaptive weighted clustering algorithm designed specifically for economic and policy analysis. This algorithm extends traditional clustering methods with dynamic feature weighting and robust centroid updates to handle the complexities of real-world economic datasets.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Feature Weighting**: Automatically adjusts feature importance during clustering based on intra-cluster dispersion
- **Robust Centroid Calculation**: Hybrid mean-median approach for outlier-resistant cluster updates  
- **Economic Data Optimization**: Tailored for regional, firm-level, and labor market datasets
- **Convergence-Based Efficiency**: Stops automatically when cluster assignments stabilize

## Applications

- Regional economic profiling and development initiatives
- Industrial strategy through firm segmentation
- Labor market analysis for skills and automation risk assessment
- Targeted policy intervention design
