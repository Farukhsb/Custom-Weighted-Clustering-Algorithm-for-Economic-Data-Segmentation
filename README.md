# Custom-Weighted-Clustering-Algorithm-for-Economic-Data-Segmentation
A sophisticated Python implementation of an adaptive weighted clustering algorithm designed specifically for economic and policy analysis. This algorithm extends traditional clustering methods with dynamic feature weighting and robust centroid updates to handle the complexities of real-world economic datasets.
Key Features:

Adaptive Feature Weighting: Automatically adjusts feature importance during clustering based on intra-cluster dispersion

Robust Centroid Calculation: Hybrid mean-median approach for outlier-resistant cluster updates

Economic Data Optimization: Tailored for regional, firm-level, and labor market datasets

Convergence-Based Efficiency: Stops automatically when cluster assignments stabilize
